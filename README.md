  # Flutter Setup Verification

  ## 📋 Setup Process
  - ✅ **Flutter SDK installed and added to PATH**
  - ✅ **Android Studio with Flutter/Dart plugins installed**
  - ✅ **Pixel 6 emulator created (Android 13)**
  - ✅ **First Flutter app built and running**

  ---

  ## 📸 Verification Screenshots

  ### **Flutter Doctor Output**
  ![flutter_doctor](flutter_doctor.png)  
  _All checks passing — environment ready._

  ### **Running Application**
  ![First Flutter App](flutter_app.png)  
  _Default Flutter counter app running successfully on the emulator._

  ---

  ## 📝 Reflection
  The setup process was straightforward but required careful attention to system configurations.  
  The main challenges involved:

  - Setting up proper **PATH environment variables**
  - Accepting **Android licenses**  
  - Ensuring Android Studio plugins were installed correctly

  Once configured, the Flutter development environment worked smoothly.  
  The **hot reload** feature especially stood out — it will significantly speed up our development for the **MediQueue hospital queue management system**.

  This complete and verified setup ensures a consistent and reliable environment for the entire team to begin building and testing our Flutter application.

  # 📁 Project Structure & Design Approach

  ## 📂 Purpose of Each Directory

  - **lib/**  
    Contains all the Dart source code for the application.

  - **screens/**  
    Holds individual UI screens, separated by user roles such as patient and admin.

  - **widgets/**  
    Stores reusable UI components like buttons and cards to avoid code duplication.

  - **models/**  
    Defines data models such as Patient, Queue, and Hospital, representing the app’s core data structures.

  - **services/**  
    Contains business logic and Firebase-related operations like authentication, queue handling, and notifications.

  - **utils/**  
    Includes constants, theme colors, and helper functions used across the app.

  ---

  ## 🧩 How This Structure Supports Modular App Design

  This folder structure separates UI, business logic, and data models, making the codebase easier to understand, maintain, and scale. By isolating reusable widgets and services, new features can be added without impacting existing screens. This modular approach is especially useful for MediQueue as it will later integrate real-time Firebase updates and role-based workflows.

  ---

  ## 🏷️ Naming Conventions

  - **Files & folders:**  
    `snake_case.dart` for readability and consistency.

  - **Classes & widgets:**  
    `PascalCase` (e.g., `WelcomeScreen`, `PatientModel`).

  - **Variables & methods:**  
    `camelCase` following Dart best practices.

  - **Widgets:**  
    Named based on their responsibility (e.g., `PrimaryButton`, `AdminDashboardScreen`).


  # 📱 Responsive Welcome Screen – MediQueue

  ## 📌 Overview
  This screen demonstrates how responsive and adaptive user interfaces can be built in Flutter.  
  The **Welcome Screen** of **MediQueue** dynamically adjusts its layout, spacing, and text sizes to provide a consistent user experience across different screen sizes and orientations, including mobile phones and tablets.

  ---

  ## 🛠️ Responsiveness Implementation
  Responsiveness is implemented directly in `welcome_screen.dart` using **MediaQuery** and **LayoutBuilder**.

  ```dart
  final screenSize = MediaQuery.of(context).size;
  final isTablet = screenSize.width > 600;

  ```

  ## Flutter & Dart Fundamentals in MediQueue

  ### StatelessWidget vs StatefulWidget
  In MediQueue, StatelessWidget is used for static UI elements such as logos and labels, while StatefulWidget is used for dynamic components like live queue position and admin controls that update based on real-time data.

  ### Widget Tree & Reactive UI
  MediQueue follows Flutter’s widget tree structure where UI is composed of nested widgets. When queue data changes in Firestore, Flutter rebuilds only the affected widgets, ensuring smooth real-time updates.

  ### Why Dart is Ideal for MediQueue
  Dart provides strong typing, null safety, and async/await support, making it suitable for handling real-time data and maintaining application stability in MediQueue.

# 📱 Using Hot Reload, Debug Console, and Flutter DevTools Effectively

## 🧩 Project Title
Flutter Development Tools Demonstration

---

## 📖 Project Description

Hot Reload allows developers to instantly apply code changes to a running Flutter application without restarting it or losing its current state.

**Steps Performed:**
1. Ran the Flutter app using `flutter run`
2. Modified a widget’s text or color
3. Saved the file
4. Observed immediate UI updates using Hot Reload

**Example Code Change:**
```dart
// Before
Text('Hello, Flutter!');

// After
Text('Welcome to Hot Reload!');

# 📱 MediQueue – Patient Profile Screen

## 🧩 Project Title
Responsive Patient Profile Screen (MediQueue)

## 📖 Project Description

The screen is part of the MediQueue application and adapts smoothly across different device sizes.

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies Used
- Flutter  
- Dart  
- Material UI  
- Android Emulator / Physical Device  

## 🚀 Features Demonstrated

### Responsive Layout Design
The profile screen adjusts its layout based on screen width to ensure a consistent user experience on mobile and larger devices.

### Key Concepts Used
- Column for vertical layout  
- Row for icon–text alignment  
- Container and Card for structured UI  
- MediaQuery for responsiveness  

### Example Code
```dart
Row(
  children: [
    Icon(Icons.email),
    Text('claudia@email.com'),
  ],
);

# Reusable Custom Widgets – TeamName
## Overview

This Flutter project demonstrates reusable custom widgets to make UI modular, maintainable, and consistent. Instead of duplicating code, widgets like buttons and cards can be reused across multiple screens.

Problem:-

Repeated UI code causes:
Inconsistent design
Hard-to-maintain code
Slower development

Solution:-

Create custom widgets:
Stateless – e.g., CustomButton (configurable label, color, action)
Stateful – e.g., LikeButton (toggles state on tap)

Features:-

Reusable buttons, cards, and toggles
Modular UI for fast development
Easy maintenance and consistent design

Benefits:-
Consistent design across screens
Less duplicated code
Easier updates and maintenance
Faster development


# Widget Tree & Reactive UI – TeamName
##Overview

This demo showcases Flutter’s widget tree and reactive UI model. Widgets are organized hierarchically, and changes in state automatically update only the affected parts of the UI.

Key Concepts:-
Widget Tree: Hierarchical structure of UI elements, from parent containers to child widgets.
Reactive UI: Flutter efficiently rebuilds only widgets affected by state changes.
State Management: Demonstrated using setState() to trigger UI updates dynamically.

Demo:-
Interactive elements update the UI without redrawing the whole screen.
Example interactions include changing text, toggling visibility, or updating counters.
Screenshots capture both the initial state and the updated state after interaction.

Reflection:-
Using a widget tree keeps UI structured and maintainable.
Reactive updates enhance performance and ensure smooth user experiences.
Modular widget design allows code reuse and easier feature additions.

Responsive Layout
Overview
This demo shows a responsive layout in Flutter using Container, Row, and Column.
The layout adapts to different screen sizes for phones and tablets.

Key Concepts
Container: Holds widgets with padding, size, and color.
Row: Horizontal arrangement of widgets.
Column: Vertical arrangement of widgets.
MediaQuery & Expanded: Make layout responsive.

Demo
Header Section at the top.
Two-Panel Layout scales proportionally and stacks on small screens.

Reflection
Layout adapts well across devices.
Expanded and MediaQuery help maintain proportions.
